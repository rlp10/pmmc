Poor Man's Media Centre
=======================

This is a bash script for selecting media to play using dmenu.

There are options to set at the top of the script itself, including the base directory of your media.

Select a directory to browse its contents.

Select ".." to browse the parent director.

Select "quit" to quit.

That's it. :)
